When you wish to build SDCC from source using MSVC on Windows (instead of using the official autoconf/configure script for UNIX), at least reckon with these, before loading the provided MSVC solution (.sln file):


## missing gawk and/or flex + bison

Make sure to add these paths to your environment PATH set (via right-click on This Computer -> Properties -> Advanced Properties -> Environment (button):

```
C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin
C:\git-sdk-64\usr\bin
```

The first is for a viable gawk.exe, the latter for a viable `flex.exe` and `bison.exe`. This assumes you have installed a full-fledged git-for-windows SDK install. Alternatively you can grab flex + bison from https://github.com/lexxmark/winflexbison/releases/tag/v2.5.25, but then you'll have to rename those win_flex.exe -> flex.exe and win_bison.exe --> bison.exe, next to adding that directory to the PATH environment PATH set.
